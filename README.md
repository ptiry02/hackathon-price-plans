# Hackathon Price plans

This is my submition to the 2022 "Jump 2 Digital" hackathon challenge.

Done with React.js. I started the project with my own [base template](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ptiry02/cra-template-base-template).

I used the styled-components library for styling; That way I can style any element from the component file.

For the modal pop-up I used Context API. The submit button on the modal just closes the modal, there is no back-end connection.
